<!-- 
<html> is the root element of the Web page - without it, the page wouldn't load
<head> is the container in which metadata is stored - the browser interprets any elements placed within it as something that should not be displayed on the Web page itself
<title> displays the page's title in the tab/window the Web page occupies
<meta> stores the relevant metadata of the page, such as character encoding, search engine keywords, etc.
<body> is the container in which all the visible elements of the page are stored - the browser interprets any elements placed within it as something that should be displayed on the Web page itself
<script> is where you would store JavaScript, either as references to external code (using the src attribute, as above) or as inline scripting (not generally recommended)
